# MQL4_Public

## Summary
Some MQL4 code that I've either written or that I've found useful. Thought I'd share as it may helps other developers or traders. 

I'm actively developing a couple of projects for fun including:

   * Horror Expert Advisor (short for horizontal expert advisor)
A simple bot that allows you place and manage trades through lines and buttons.
It's fairly customised to my personal preferences but it can be easily modified.
   * TradeQuickLook is an indicator. 
A simple proof of concept indicator that I'm working on to assist a trader in quickly showing useful information like targets and stops by simply clicking on a candle. Quite useful for manual backtesting or before taking a live trade. Fairly basic at the moment.

Contributions and thoughts welcome :-)

There is quite a bit of other code as well, some going back a couple years. Browse through and enjoy.
